## Dance the Art Genome

A choreography project in collaboration between [@sicchio](https://github.com/sicchio) and [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock) that uses genes from the [Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net).

You can see this code run at [dance-the-art-genome.herokuapp.com](https://dance-the-art-genome.herokuapp.com).

This is the score for a contemporary dance performance for one or more dancers. Here the API is a choreography that is danced.

Ideally the piece is 15 minutes in length and performed with the API projected into the performance space (floor or wall) so that the dancer and audience can read the score.

The piece begins with a characteristic from the Artsy art genome and the dancer interprets this into movement. This is at first a slow change from characteristic to characteristic, giving the dancer time to explore and develop a vocabulary for the words forming the score. No more than 3 changes in the first minute of the piece. Afterwards should be an incremental development of the speed of change of the score. The maximum rate should be 10 things per minute. Ten minutes within to the piece, the rate of change should slow to the original pace until the end at 15 minutes, resulting in a pattern of slow, fast, slow. The reverse of this timing (fast to slow to fast) is also permissible.
